# Installations:
Python - 3.6

# Python Libraries :
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras
  - Numpy
  - sklearn
  - matplotlib
# Steps
  - Update the paths in .py files according to the location of the files.
  - Run the header_extraction.py file for malware and benign file separately. After running you should see "extracted_header" files       created.
  - Run high_level_feature_extraction.py to extract new feature using Convolutional Neural Network.
  - Run BGAN.py to generate new malware samples, extracted features for malware samples in previouse step are the training data for this step.
  - oversample the training set with generated samples by BGAN and run deepNetwork.py with malware and benign files for classification purpose.
